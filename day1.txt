1)Explore and explain the various methods in console functions.Explain them

-Console Print
<void> rconsoleprint(<string> message)
Prints message into the console. rconsoleprint also supports colors.

-Console Info
<void> rconsoleinfo(<string> message)
Prints message into the console, with a info text before it.

-Console Warn
<void> rconsolewarn(<string> message)
Prints message into the console, with a warning text before it.

-Console Error
<void> rconsoleerr(<string> message)
Prints message into the console, with a error text before it.

-Console Clear
<void> rconsoleclear(<void>)
Clears the console.

-Console Name
<void> rconsolename(<string> title)
Sets the currently allocated console title to title.

-Console Input
<string> rconsoleinput(<void>)
Yields until the user inputs information into their console. Returns the input they put in.

-Print Console
<void> printconsole(<string> message, <byte> red, <byte> green, <byte> blue)
Prints message into the internal and integrated console with RGB value. To view the internal console, enable Internal UI in the Options menu and when in-game press INSERT on your keyboard. The integrated console can be found in the new synapse UI.

 2) Write the difference between var,let and const with code examples.

In Javascript one can define variables using the keywords var, let or const.
var a=10;
let b=20;
const PI=3.14;
var: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword "var" is limited to the "function" within which it is defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
var is "function scoped".
code:
 var greeter = "hey hi";
    var times = 4;

    if (times > 3) {
        var greeter = "say Hello instead"; 
    }
    
    console.log(greeter) // "say Hello instead"

let: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword "let" or "const" is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
"let" and "const" are "block scoped".
code:
let greeting = "say Hi";
    if (true) {
        let greeting = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(greeting); // "say Hello instead"
    }
    console.log(greeting); // "say Hi"

const: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword "const" is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
"const" cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.
code:
 const greeting = {
        message: "say Hi",
        times: 4
    }

3) Write a breif intro on available datatypes in JavaScript.

JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

1.Primitive data type
2.Non-primitive (reference) data type

1.JavaScript primitive data types
There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:

Data Type	            Description
String	                represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
Number           	represents numeric values e.g. 100
Boolean	                represents boolean value either false or true
Undefined	        represents undefined value
Null	                represents null i.e. no value at all

2.JavaScript non-primitive data types
The non-primitive data types are as follows:

Data Type	           Description
Object	               represents instance through which we can access members
Array                  represents group of similar values
RegExp	               represents regular expression
